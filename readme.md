## üëå Update template colors

Plex is built with Sass but relies on native CSS variables with HSL for colors. To change the template theme colors:

* Open bulma-css-vars.config.js and change the HSL value of the primary color:

```
primary: hsl(337, 78, 57),
```

* Then, edit the value of the primary, secondary and accent colors inside `src/scss/css-variables/colors.scss`:

```
// primary HSL (#e73c7d) // hsl(337, 78%, 57%)
@include colorHsl("primary", 337, 78%, 57%);

// secondary HSL (#7938f4) // hsl(261, 90%, 59%)
@include colorHsl("secondary", 261, 90%, 59%);

// accent HSL (#3bf486) // hsl(144, 89%, 59%)
@include colorHsl("accent", 144, 89%, 59%);
```

* Once you're done, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run build:update-bulma-colors
```

### Note

Changes should be commited to `src/` files only.

### Tools

The template is built with Sass and Gulp build system with these features:

-	Handlebars HTML templates with Panini‚Äì Panini is a super simple flat file generator for use with Gulp. It compiles a series of HTML pages using a common layout. These pages can also include HTML partials, external Handlebars helpers, or external data as JSON.
-	Sass compilation, prefixing with Autoprefixer, and JavaScript concatenation
-	Built-in BrowserSync server - Will automatically reload your page when files are changed. It also live-injects CSS changes when you save a Sass file. This task runs continuously. Defaults to localhost.
-	For production builds - CSS compression, JavaScript compression, Image compression and more..
